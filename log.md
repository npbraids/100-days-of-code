# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 29, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Github, set up a new reposityr and learned about 100 days of code. Thought to myself, one hour a day sound hard given my current schedule but needed to make actual gain, so I'm going to give it a try.

**Thoughts: Here's a list of things I can use this project to do** 
Use coding to use R with ease. 
Make better use of Github and find database resources.
Build a personal website

**Resources: (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/learn-how-free-code-camp-works)**
Signed up and looked around site to see how to best organize my day to get in an hour/day.
